To use the anagram file use:

bash ./anagram INPUT_FILE OUTPUT_FILE

INPUT_FILE is the file for which we will search for anagrams
OUTPUT_FILE is the file we output the anagram classes to

OUTPUT_FILE is an optional argument, if is not there, then the program will
automatically output (and overwrite if out already exists) to a file called out
